🎲 Connect 4 Game
Welcome to my version of the classic Connect 4 game! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, keeping it simple yet fully functional. It's a fun, two-player game where strategy and quick thinking determine the winner! 😊

🎮 About the Game
Connect 4 is a two-player board game where players take turns dropping their colored discs into a 6x7 grid. The goal is simple: connect four discs in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does! If the grid fills up without a winner, it's a draw.

This game is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to play, making it a great way to pass the time with friends or family.

✨ Features
✅ Interactive 6x7 grid – Click on a column to drop your disc! ✅ Two-player mode – Challenge a friend and see who wins! ✅ Automatic win detection – The game checks for wins and announces the winner. ✅ Draw detection – If the grid fills up without a winner, it's a tie. ✅ Simple yet smooth animations – Enjoy a polished game experience!
